# OSU_FALL_2022_HACKATHON
OSU FALL 2022 Hackathon

Presented by Oregon State University's Hackathon Club, our quarterly hackathons ("Beaverhacks") gives the OSU community opportunities to learn new skills, build cool stuff, and compete for prizes. Weâ€™re beginner-friendly, inclusive of all backgrounds, and focused on fun!
You can build your project in any way and in the format you'd like, e.g. web app, mobile app, browser extension...the possibilities are endless! This quarter's hackathon theme is Life Hacks -- and you can build your project in any way that reflects that, however note that judges will rate your project according to its relevance to the theme (check out the other judging criteria below!).

REQUIREMENTS: A completed project submission will include:
Link to a video demonstration of the project (screen recording + audio) with a max-duration of 5 minutes. We recommend uploading your video to Youtube (make sure the privacy setting is public or unlisted). 
Feel free to use this template as a starting point for your video presentation. It's not required and no extra points will be given. We have found, however, that presentations with a solid structure do a better job communicating the project to the judges so please keep that in mind in coming up with your format.
Link to Github repository - the entire commit history must be present
Link to repl on Repl.it (only if submitting a console app)
Detailed description about your app - this information will help the judges assess and review your work!
